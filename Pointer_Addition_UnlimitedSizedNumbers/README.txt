This program reads in two files which have one digit (or a decimal) on each line,

It will then read in each number in the file and represent them all as a number (singly linked list). 
Since each digit is simply a node in our linked list we may use files with numbers thousands of digits long!


Once both linked lists are build it will call the SumP function which will perform the summing procedure and return a pointer to a singly linked list which is the result of addition.
